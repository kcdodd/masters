## Master Thesis Document Collection
=====

This is a collection of data, model code, and other documents which I used in the completion
of my master's thesis.

These works were at one time scattered among many different computers and storage
devices, but I have attempted to combine them into a semi-coherent collection. I
have also attempted to remove all content which may be covered by copyright by other
institutions. I make no guarantee that file references or other dependencies are complete.

These files should be used as reference only, and should be used with caution. Multiple
versions of some files exist (git was not used in any versioning up to this point),
and no guarantee is made of their accuracy.
Again, caution should be used in attempting to use any of this in future works.
